# Finuxia — Frontend

A CRM and productivity platform for financial advisors, built with **React +
Vite + Tailwind CSS**. Talks to the [Finuxia backend](https://github.com/mahdisanjari/Finuxia_Backend)
(Django REST API) over JSON.

## Features

- **Client pipeline** — stages, notes, per-client files, and a daily task checklist
- **Booking** — shareable booking links, availability, and a public client-facing booking page
- **Automated follow-ups** — AI-drafted, scheduled follow-up emails per client
- **Sales Package Prep** — a guided wizard that collects client/product data, drafts an AI Reason Why Letter, generates compliance forms, and assembles a signature-ready package
- **Strategy Prep** and **Presentations** — AI-assisted advisor tooling and a shared presentation library
- **Integrations** — Google Calendar, Google Drive, and Zoom, each connected per-advisor
- **Plans & billing** — module-gated subscription plans with a Stripe-ready checkout flow
- **Reports** and a live-editable **Guide** (managed from the backend admin)

## Run it

**1. Start the backend first** — see the [backend README](https://github.com/mahdisanjari/Finuxia_Backend) for setup.

**2. Start the frontend:**

```bash
npm install
npm run dev             # http://localhost:5173
```

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the backend URL:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

## How data flows

- **Auth** is JWT — the token is stored in `localStorage` and attached to every request.
- **Clients & daily state** load from the API on login, render instantly from a
  per-user cache, and sync back with a debounced `PUT` on every change (optimistic).
- **Guide** content is fetched live from `/api/guides` and edited in the Django admin.
- **Billing** status (which plan/modules an account has) is fetched on login and
  gates the relevant pages client-side, mirroring what the backend itself enforces.

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the Vite dev server |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build |
| `npm test` | Run the tests once (Vitest, jsdom) |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run the tests and re-run on change |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run the tests with coverage; fails below the floor in `vite.config.js` |

## Testing

- **Stack:** Vitest (the Vite test runner), jsdom, React Testing Library, `user-event`, and MSW (Mock Service Worker) to mock the API at the network level, so the real API client, cookies, CSRF header and refresh-and-retry run in tests.
- **Test files** sit next to the code: `src/lib/api.test.js`, `src/context/AuthContext.test.jsx`, ...
- **`src/test/utils.jsx`:** `renderWithProviders(ui, { route })` renders inside the application's provider tree (router, toasts, auth, Google Calendar, clients, the same order as `main.jsx`); use it instead of assembling providers in each test. It also re-exports Testing Library.
- **`src/test/handlers.js`:** the default API answers (a signed-in advisor with no clients). Override per test with `server.use(http.get(`${API}/api/...`, () => HttpResponse.json(...)))`. A request with no handler fails the test, so nothing ever reaches a real network.
- **Coverage floor:** set just under what the tests cover today (most of the app is not yet tested). Raise the numbers in `vite.config.js` whenever coverage goes up; never lower them.
- **CI:** the `test` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `npm run test:coverage`. It runs on a push to **any** branch, not only `main` and `develop`, so a branch handed over for review has already been tested somewhere other than its author's machine. Still to do, and not a code change: mark `test` and `build` as required status checks for `main` and `develop` in the repository's branch protection settings, which needs repository admin access.

## Error tracking

`src/lib/errorTracking.js` (OPS-01). **Off unless `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` is set**, and with no DSN the
bundle contains none of the SDK — Vite inlines the empty value, so the dynamic import becomes dead
code and is dropped. Set the DSN in `.env.production`; see `.env.example` for the other three
variables.

- **Loaded on demand.** The SDK lives in `src/lib/sentryClient.js`, reached by a dynamic import, so
  it is a separate 24 kB gzip chunk and stays out of the first load. That is not optional: the
  first-load budget in `scripts/check-bundle.mjs` is 90 kB gzip and the app uses 79.9 kB, so a
  static import would fail the build. `sentryClient.js` exists purely so the SDK is reached through
  *static named* imports and can be tree-shaken — importing `@sentry/react` directly in a dynamic
  import pulls the whole namespace and measured 117 kB instead of 24 kB.
- **Errors in the first render are not lost.** Because the SDK arrives asynchronously, there is a
  window with no reporter installed. `src/lib/errorReporting.js` buffers reports made in that window
  (capped at 10) and flushes them when the reporter arrives.
- **Every URL is cut at the `?` before it leaves.** `/reset-password?uid=..&token=..` carries a live
  password-reset token; a breadcrumb recording that navigation would send a working credential to a
  third party. This applies to the event, to each breadcrumb, and to the `route` tag.
- **DOM and console breadcrumbs are off**, rather than collected and scrubbed: DOM breadcrumbs record
  the text of what was clicked, which here is a client's name. Session Replay is off — it would record
  the screen, and the screen shows clients' identity documents.
- **The reference on the error screen is a tag.** The `errorId` the recovery screen shows the customer
  is sent as `error_id`, and the backend's `X-Request-ID` from the most recent API response is sent as
  `request_id`, so a support call quoting either one finds the event and the matching server logs.

## Bundle size and code splitting

Every page is loaded on demand (`React.lazy`), so a visitor downloads the shell and the page they open, not the whole app. The public pages (login, register, password reset, privacy, terms, support, the booking page, Zoom docs) never import the signed-in application (`src/AuthenticatedApp.jsx`: the layout, the route table and every page), and the Excel libraries load only when an import or export is actually used. Loading spinners reuse `PageSpinner`: full screen while the app or an out-of-layout page loads, inline inside the layout so the navigation stays put.

| First visit (gzip) | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Entry JS + CSS (what every visitor downloads) | 166 kB (159.5 JS + 6.6 CSS) | 79 kB |
| Public booking page | 166 kB | 85 kB |
| Login page | 166 kB | 81 kB |
| Largest page chunk, loaded on demand (Sales Package Prep) | in the entry | 14 kB |
| Excel libraries (only on import / export) | on demand | on demand (unchanged, 464 kB) |

`npm run check:bundle` (run after `npm run build`, and in CI) fails if the first load statically imports the signed-in shell, a page of it or an Excel library, if a public page does, or if the first-load gzip size passes the budget in `scripts/check-bundle.mjs`. Raise the budget only on purpose, with the change that adds the weight. Chunks are same-origin files, so the Content Security Policy (`script-src 'self'`) is unaffected.
